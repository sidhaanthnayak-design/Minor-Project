# *WEEKLY PROJECT*
This repository contains three Python projects focused on practical problem solving and data handling.

Expense Tracker (ExpenseTrackerUnlox.ipynb): A simple expense tracking program that helps users record and analyze their spending. It demonstrates the use of core Python concepts such as variables, lists, conditionals, loops, and basic calculations to manage daily expenses in a structured way.

Student Marks Analyzer (StudentMarksAnalyserUnlox.ipynb): A program that analyzes student marks using Python and NumPy. It calculates total, average, highest, and lowest marks, and assigns grades based on defined rules. This project highlights array operations and shows the usefulness of NumPy for numerical analysis.

Student Performance Analyzer (StudentAcademicPerfAnalyser.ipynb): An extended analysis of student academic performance that evaluates overall results using multiple metrics. It focuses on performance trends, comparisons, and summary insights, demonstrating structured data analysis and reinforcing the application of Python and NumPy in educational datasets.
