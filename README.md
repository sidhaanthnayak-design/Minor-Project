This repository contains two Python projects focused on practical problem solving and data handling.

Expense Tracker (ExpenseTrackerUnlox.ipynb):
A simple expense tracking program that helps users record and analyze their spending. It demonstrates the use of Python basics such as variables, lists, conditionals, loops, and basic calculations to manage daily expenses in a structured way.

Student Marks Analyzer (StudentMarksAnalyserUnlox.ipynb):
A program that analyzes student marks using Python and NumPy. It calculates total, average, highest and lowest marks, and assigns grades based on defined rules. The project highlights array operations and shows why NumPy is useful for numerical analysis.
